## Overview of the statistical analysis:
While on vacation to Hawaii last year we've discovered a new found passion for surfing and have been trying to come up with a plan that will let us not just to return to Hawaii, but live there forever.
We've finally came up with as idea of a Surf n' Shake shop serving surfboards and ice creams to locals, tourists and of course ourselves.
We have some saving we are willing to invest but we'll need some real investor backing to get this off the ground.

W. Avy is an investor who is famous for his love of surfing and who seems to like our idea. However, he is concerned about the weather and requests more information about temperature trends before investing in a the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:
The results for the analysis can be seen in [SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb](https://github.com/Cryptotwister/surfs_up/blob/main/SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb) jupyter notebook.
There are the following differences in temperature data for the month of June and December below:
* June stats:

* December stats:

1. For the month of June there are 1700 records while for December only 1517 records.

2. For June the mean temperature is at 75 degrees. At least 25% of the days the temperture is around 73 degrees, everthough the minimum was set at 64 degrees and the maximum 85. The standard deviation is almost the same at 3.26 for June. The median is also the same as mean which means results are not skewed.

3. For December the mean temperature is 4 degrees less - set at 71. The minimum temperature for the month of december is 56 degrees and for 25% of the days will remain at or below 69 degrees. The standard deviation is almost the same at 3.75 for december. The median is also the same as mean which means results are not skewed.

## Summary:
We can see that temperatures are quiet reliable and predictable in Oahu even December month has some good days. Looks like a Surf n' Shake shop might be soon on the cards.
